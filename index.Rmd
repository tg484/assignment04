## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r file download}
pulse_data <- read_csv("data/pulse2022_puf_41.csv")
pulse_weights <- read_csv("data/pulse2022_repwgt_puf_41.csv")
pulse_join <- full_join(pulse_data, pulse_weights, by = "SCRAM")
svy_all <- pulse_join %>%
  as_survey_rep(
    repweights = dplyr::matches("PWEIGHT[0-9]+"),
    weights = PWEIGHT,
    type = "BRR",
    mse = TRUE
  )
```

## Including Plots


```{r vaccination plans}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
